# Flood Modeling and CDFW Jurisdiction — Process Notes

## 2D HEC-RAS modeling

- **2D HEC-RAS modeling** is typically used to determine the **flood regime** by estimating:
  - 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 100-, and 200-year flood events
- Results are used to **recommend project design elements**.

## CDFW jurisdiction

- **CDFW** (California Department of Fish and Wildlife) has jurisdiction over the **bed, bank, and channel** of the stream.
- Extent of jurisdiction is **not** defined by a fixed buffer. It is determined **case by case**, by:
  - **Site visit**, or  
  - **Modeling review**

## Support

- **Conservation Engineering Branch** is typically asked to assist with:
  - Modeling, and  
  - Design review

*Note: The 200 m buffer used in this repo’s GIS clipping script is for preparing HEC-RAS inputs (DEM and shapefiles) only. It does not establish or represent CDFW jurisdictional limits.*
